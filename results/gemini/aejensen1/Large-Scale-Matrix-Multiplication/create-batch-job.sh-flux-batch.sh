# This is a template for a Flux batch script that would be generated by a modified version
# of the original wrapper script. The variables starting with '$' (e.g., $job_name)
# are assumed to be substituted by the generator script, similar to how the original
# script generates the Slurm sbatch file.

# This example shows the Flux script generated for a C program.
# A similar script would be generated for Python
